Introducing Active Machine Learning
Machine learning models require large, labeled datasets, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Active machine learning (active ML) minimizes the labeling effort needed by intelligently choosing which data points a human should label. In this book, you will gain the necessary knowledge to understand active learning, including its mechanisms and applications. With these fundamentals, the subsequent chapters will equip you with concrete skills to implement active learning techniques on your own.
By the end of this book, you will have practical experience with state-of-the-art strategies to minimize labeling costs and maximize model performance. You will be able to apply active learning to enhance ...

Designing Query Strategy Frameworks
Query strategies act as the engine that drives active ML and determines which data points get selected for labeling. In this chapter, we aim to provide a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the most widely used and highly effective query strategy frameworks that are employed in active ML. These frameworks play a crucial role in the field of active ML, aiding in selecting informative and representative data points for labeling. The strategies that we will delve into include uncertainty sampling, query-by-committee, expected model change (EMC), expected error reduction (EER), and density-weighted methods. By thoroughly understanding these frameworks and the underlying principles, you can make informed ...

Managing the Human in the Loop
Active ML promises more efficient ML by intelligently selecting the most informative samples for labeling by human oracles. However, the success of these human-in-the-loop systems depends on effective interface design and workflow management. In this chapter, we will cover best practices for optimizing the human role in active ML. First, we will explore interactive system design, discussing how to create labeling interfaces that enable efficient and accurate annotations. Next, we will provide an extensive overview of the leading human-in-the-loop frameworks for managing the labeling pipeline. We will then turn to handling model-label disagreements through adjudication and quality control. After that, we will ...

Applying Active Learning to Computer Vision
In this chapter, we will dive into using active learning techniques for computer vision tasks. Computer vision involves analyzing visual data such as images and videos to extract useful information. It relies heavily on machine learning models such as convolutional neural networks. However, these models require large labeled training sets, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Active ML provides a solution by interactively querying the user to label only the most informative examples. This chapter demonstrates how to implement uncertainty sampling for diverse computer vision tasks. By the end, you will have the tools to efficiently train computer vision models with optimized labeling ...

Leveraging Active Learning for Big Data
In this chapter, we will explore how to use machine learning (ML) to deal with big data, such as videos. The task of developing ML models for video analysis comes with its own set of unique challenges. Videos, being inherently large, pose significant hurdles in terms of efficient processing. Video analysis using ML has become an increasingly important technique across many industries and applications. From autonomous vehicles that rely on computer vision models to analyze road conditions in real-time video feeds, to security systems that can automatically detect suspicious activity, ML is revolutionizing what’s possible with video data. These models can automate time-consuming manual analysis and provide ...
